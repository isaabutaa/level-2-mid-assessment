## Part 1

In part 1, I ask you to complete a number of simple exercises that give you an opportunity to practice the following:

    - arr.map
    - arr.filter
    - arr.find
    - arr.sort
    - arr.reduce
    - setInterval & setTimeout

Why are higher order functions/arr methods useful? Well, in short, they're very useful when you're trying to manipulate and navigate collections of data. If you have an app with users, you're going to want to be able to filter out certain users so that you can give them an individualized experience. Or if you're receiving a collection of data from a third-party source, maybe you'll want to map through that data so that you can render each item on the browser page. There are all kinds of use cases, and being familiar with these methods and others will help you immensely in the course and in your career as a developer.

Set interval and set timeout are in here because there's another assignment in level 2 where you're required to use it. Hopefully this practice helps.
